## Hello ^v^
I just make projects, put almost all my effort into them, then let it die.

## Other things:
 - I have no socials except Discord which I don't use that much, so don't ask.
 - I've learned Python and JavaScript
 - WebAssembly is a pain in the ass

That's it, I suppose. Does github-readme-stats grade you on commits, by the way?
