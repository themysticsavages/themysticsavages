## Hello. ^v^
Usually now and then, I just make projects, for me and GitHub. I mostly code in Python. Other times I code in C# or VB.NET. I may try different languages someday. I'm not exactly a web developer, so I don't make a ton of web-based code.

## Other things:
 - I have a slowly growing YouTube channel (@TheMysticSavages)!
 - I had a Discord server, but now I don't have it.
 - I post amazing projects on scratch.mit.edu (@ajskateboarder).
__I don't make stuff for monetary gain__.
