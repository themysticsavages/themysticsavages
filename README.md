## Hello ^v^
Usually now and then, I just make projects, usually to spend time actually making something interesting. I have too much time on my hands 😐

I mostly code in Python, but I like to try different languages sometimes, like NodeJS or something.

## Other things:
 - I have a slowly growing YouTube channel ([@TheMysticSavages](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvoqZwGXZ1ix4AIrtHDBuw))!
 - I post amazing projects on scratch.mit.edu ([@ajskateboarder](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ajskateboarder/)).
