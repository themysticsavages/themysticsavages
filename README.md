## Hello ^v^
I just make projects and seldom work on them after a couple of months, mainly because it was a boring idea. But here are some projects I'm ACTUALLY working on:
 - [scratchhh.xyz](https://github.com/themysticsavages/scratchhh.xyz)
 - [scratch2py (contributing)](https://github.com/the-cloud-dev/scratch2py)
 - [generator3](https://github.com/themysticsavages/generator3)

## Other things:
 - I have no socials except Discord which I don't use that much, so don't ask.
 - Don't look at my old projects. They suck
